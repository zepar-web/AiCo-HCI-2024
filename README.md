Envision a digital product dedicated to groups of airsoft  players that gather around in teams in an arena to play different  airsoft matches. The user-interface will provide multi-language support  for setting up the player teams, game type (for example, Deathmatch,  Capture the Flag, SpeedSoft, Domination, 1:1), match duration and score,  and other preferences. Moreover, the application would sync with the  internal Bluetooth unit of the weapon replica and offer information such as ammo left, battery capacity and usage, plus other maintenance data. Also, the system would also sync with a smartphone/smartwatch and a pair of  augmented reality glasses to provide – by using various data visualization techniques – the contextual information for each player  during a match.
